[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/about.html) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 
In particular, these are some of the core packages:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): the fundamental package for numerical computation. It defines the numerical array and matrix types and basic operations on them.
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) library:  a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/): a mature and popular plotting package, that provides publication-quality 2D plotting as well as rudimentary 3D plotting
- [IPython](http://ipython.org/): a rich interactive interface, letting you quickly process data and test ideas. The IPython notebook works in your web browser, allowing you to document your computation in an easily reproducible form.
- [Sympy](http://www.sympy.org/): for symbolic mathematics and computer algebra.
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/): providing high-performance, easy to use data structures.
- [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): a framework for testing Python code.

We won't cover the usage of all these packages and will only give a few examples that are meaningful when working with spatio-temporal data.
