Are you new to MetOs? 

Then this documentation is for you... 

We would like to give you an overview of the tools we are commonly using at MetOs and hopefully show you how to best use the existing infrastructure (laptop, Notur/Norstore, etc.). 

And of course if you have suggestions and would like to improve this short documentation, just let us know!
