With [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) you learn to write simple 
programs, independently from your scientific research topic. In this new lesson, we aim at
teaching you on how to work efficiently with Ocean, Weather and Climate data. It is very domain specific as all existing
[Data Carpentry lessons](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) and attempts to cover the most common needs required when 
starting in these fields of research.


We will learn:

- how to identify the most common data formats in Ocean, Weather and Climate Sciences i.e. 
[netCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_introduction.html), [HDF](https://support.hdfgroup.org/), 
[WMO GRIB and BUFR](http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/WMOCodes.html).
- How to view the content of these binary files 
- How to identify the provenance and explore metadata
- How to organise your data and develop a simple data management plan to ease your work
- About Python libraries and command line utilities commonly used in these disciplines



> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1.  Learners need to understand what files and directories are and
>     what a working directory is. These concepts are covered in the 
>     [Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson.
> 2.  Learners need to have some prior knowledge of Python. For instance,
>     what is covered in the Software Carpentry lesson 
>     [Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) 
>     is more than sufficient.
>
> 2. Learners must install Python and a few additional python libraries before the class starts.
>    See [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup/)
>
> 3. Learners must get the metos data before class starts:
>    please download and unzip the file 
>    [metos-python-data.zip]({{page.root}}/files/metos-python-data.zip).
>
>    Please see [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup/)
>    for details.
